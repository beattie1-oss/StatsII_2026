###############################
# Today's tutorial is a refesher of the R skills we learnt in the first semester.
#     1. Importing data
#     2. Wrangling data
#     3. Analysing data
#     4. Communicating
#### Case study
# A fictional think-tank, the Alliance of Wealthy People who Dislike Tax, has asked
# you to study the relationship between tax, regulation and GDP per capita. They believe
# that countries with low tax and light regulation are wealthier, and they want you to
# prove it using statistics!
# We're going to use variables such as:
# Ease of doing business rank (1=most business-friendly regulations): IC.BUS.EASE.XQ
# GDP per capita (current US$): NY.GDP.PCAP.CD
# "tax revenue (% of GDP)": GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS
#### Importing the data
# Your csv file should now be in the desktop folder. Before opening it, we're going to
# load in our libraries.
library(tidyverse)
library(stargazer)
## loading the data
data <-
#### Wrangling the data
# We should now have a dataset where our variables are at least of the correct type.
# However, we need to do a bit of tidying to get the data into a more user-friendly
# format.
# 1. First, let's have a look at our data object. Use the functions we learned from last
#    term.
# 2. Let's drop the rows and columns we don't need.
# We only have one year, so the two cols related to year can be dropped; also, we only
# really need one col for country name, so let's drop country code too.
# 3. Let's also get rid of the variable code in square brackets
names(data) <- #hint: try using the function sub() with the regexp " \\[.*"
#### Analysing the data
# Now that we have a dataset in the desired format, we can proceed to the analysis.
# 1. Let's perform some preliminary descriptive analysis using our visualisation skills.
#    Try using ggplot to create a plot of scatter showing GDP p/c vs Tax revenue. Add a
#    simple linear regression line.
# 2. Now let's try the same using GDP p/c vs Ease of Doing Business.
# 3. And, for the sake of argument, let's see what the relationship is between Tax and
#    Ease of Doing Business.
# 4. Let's think for a minute before we perform the multivariate regression: what kind
#    of interaction are we seeing with these three plots?
# 5. Now let's run a regression!
formula <- `GDP per capita (current US$)` ~ `Tax revenue (% of GDP)` + `Ease of doing business rank (1=most business-friendly regulations)`

#### Communicating
# The final task is to communicate our results. We're going to do this in pdf format
# using latex, and then upload our results to github, just as we would with a problem
# set!
# 1. Visualisation
# We want a good visualisation of our results, including a title. We've seen that Ease
# of Doing Business doesn't seem to have a very significant effect (statistically or
# substantively), so let's plot GDP vs Tax, and include Ease of Doing Business as
# either a size or alpha variable to our scatter points. Use the "export" option in the
# plots window to create a pdf of the plot below. Save it in the same folder as your
# latex template.
